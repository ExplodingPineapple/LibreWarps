# LibreWarps

A warp system plugin with inventory-based GUI for Bukkit and Spigot based Minecraft servers.

This project aims to preserve the last known open source version of CodingAir's WarpSystem plugin, so that the community can continue to maintain and develop the free version of the plugin alongside CodingAir's premium version of the plugin, as the free version of the plugin has now been made closed-source and the source code has been removed from GitHub.

The original repo was [here](https://github.com/CodingAir/WarpSystem). You can view an archived version of the GitHub repo [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20181224133449/https://github.com/CodingAir/WarpSystem).
